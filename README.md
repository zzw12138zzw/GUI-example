GUI-example\
This is a simple program with a GUI\
Techniques involved: \
#Layout in jPanels\
#Sound in Java\
#Radio Button\
#ListSelectionModel\
#multiple JFrame\
#Input PlaceHolder in jTextArea(just like HTML)\
  \
Will need image and sound folder content to run, or you can add your own pic and sound to it\
Since Java accepts only wav sound file\
